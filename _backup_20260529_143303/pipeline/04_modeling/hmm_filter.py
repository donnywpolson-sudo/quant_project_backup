"""
hmm_filter.py — HMM Regime Filter Integration Layer.

Integrates HMM regime detection into the walkforward pipeline:
  - Runs 1H HMM inference in parallel with 5-min execution path.
  - Bridges regime probabilities to 5-min bars (forward-fill, causal).
  - Applies regime-aware trade gating in the execution layer.
  - Provides a drop-in `apply_hmm_filter()` entry point for walkforward.py.
  - Falls back gracefully when HMM fails (pass-through, log failure).
