align.py
Align higher-timeframe (1h, daily) OHLCV streams to 5-min bars.
Uses join_asof(strategy='backward') which matches each 5-min row to the
most recent HTF bar whose timestamp is <= the 5-min bar's timestamp.

CRITICAL: Daily bar timestamps are shifted forward by 1 day so that
each 5-min bar on day D matches the PREVIOUS completed day's daily bar
(at midnight D-1 shifted to midnight D), NEVER the current incomplete day.
